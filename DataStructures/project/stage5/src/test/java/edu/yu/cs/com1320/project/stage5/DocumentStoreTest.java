My plans:
    Then I will make sure that the trie stuff works with the BTree correctly, and doesn't store docs in the trie
    Then I will make sure that undo works with the BTree correctly
    Then I will make sure that memory usage works correctly, including all the horrible stuff I am hearing about
        interacting with the Heap correctly
